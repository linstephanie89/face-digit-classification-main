# face-digit-classification
This project contains a face and digits classifier implemented using AI and machine learning techniques. The classifier is designed to determine whether a given image contains a face or a digit. It utilizes various classifier algorithms, including Perceptron, Naive Bayes, and MIRA (Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm), to achieve accurate predictions.

#Classifier Algorithms
This classifier implements the following algorithms:

Perceptron: A linear classifier that iteratively learns to separate classes using a threshold activation function.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier that applies Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between features.
MIRA: Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm, an adaptive linear classifier that updates weights based on the perceptron rule while considering the margin violations.
Each algorithm is implemented in separate modules, allowing you to experiment with different classifiers or use them individually.
